# 🚢 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic Dataset 🛳️

Excited to share my recent work on the Titanic dataset, where I conducted a thorough Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover key insights and patterns. Here's a snapshot of what I explored:

🧩 Data Overview:
Dataset: Titanic passenger data from Kaggle
Objective: Understand passenger demographics and survival rates
🔍 Key Findings:
Passenger Demographics:

Age Distribution: Notable differences between survival rates of different age groups.
Gender Impact: Women and children had a significantly higher survival rate compared to men.
Class Analysis: First-class passengers had the highest survival rate, followed by second and third class.
Missing Data Handling:

Addressed missing values in Age, Embarked, and Cabin columns using imputation and feature engineering techniques.
Survival Analysis:

Survival Rate by Class: Clear correlation between passenger class and survival probability.
Survival Rate by Gender: Women had a much higher chance of survival compared to men.
Family Size Influence: Passengers traveling alone had a lower survival rate than those traveling with family.
Visualizations:

Created insightful visualizations to illustrate the relationship between features and survival rates, including histograms, bar plots, and heatmaps.
🔧 Tools & Techniques:
Python Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Techniques: Data Cleaning, Feature Engineering, Statistical Analysis, Data Visualization
📈 Next Steps:
Building predictive models to forecast survival rates.
Further analysis on additional features like Cabin and Ticket for deeper insights.
Check out the detailed analysis and visualizations in my Jupyter Notebook and explore how data can tell compelling stories. 🚀
